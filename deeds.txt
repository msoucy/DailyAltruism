Hold the door for a stranger
Smile at three people in the hallway
Teach someone an interesting fact
Message someone you haven't talked to in a while
Play with your pet
Tell someone how much they mean to you
Write an inspirational message for a stranger to find
Let someone merge in front of you in traffic
Be patient with someone who has been frustrating you - you don't know what's going on in their life
Pick up a piece of trash that you see lying around
Ask a friend if they're alright
Thank your cashier or waiter
